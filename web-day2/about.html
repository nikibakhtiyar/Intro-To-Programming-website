  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Niki Bakhtiyar, also known as <strong>Niqi</strong>. I'm a techno DJ and producer based in Boston, currently studying Electronic Production & Design at Berklee College of Music.</p>

  <p>I focus on hypnotic, percussive, stripped-down techno with a cinematic edge. I perform using hardware, custom sound design, and live improvisation.</p>

  <p>When I'm not producing or DJing, I'm exploring new ways to merge sound design, technology, and storytelling.</p>
